This project showcases a simple Robo Car built using Arduino, designed for embedded systems applications. The Robo Car is capable of basic autonomous movement and control, utilizing sensors for obstacle detection and a motor driver to control the wheels. Arduino serves as the main controller, processing sensor data and executing movement commands based on pre-programmed logic. The project demonstrates key concepts in embedded systems, such as real-time data processing, hardware-software interaction, and efficient power management, making it a great starting point for anyone exploring robotics and embedded programming.
